# myGoogleCalendar
This is to port over my shifts from Target into my personal Google Calendar.
#Read me!
Hello all! I am using the Google Calendar API for this. If you would like to use this code. You MUST be a Google Cloud developer (its free) and get a google Auth Key. 

I'll elaborate on this later. 

# I dropped in the API, now what?
